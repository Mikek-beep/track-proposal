# Data-driven operations management and reporting with Python

## Track description:

This track is a gentle introduction to using Python for data-driven business decision making. You will begin this track by discovering different types of business metrics, focusing on operational and financial metrics. You will learn how to import, clean, merge and summarise different types of metrics data, identify, analyse and visualise the most important metrics for your business and create new!

Later in this track you will discover the power of machine learning using tree-based models. Through interactive exercises, using real-world data and powerful Python tools you will train your first machine learning model, tweak it and estimate its accuracy. Most importantly, you will learn how it can help you to get answers to the very real business operations questions. You will build solid understanding of how machine learning can help your business decide where to focus resources and time, how to model your operations and even predict the revenue! 

This is an introductory track and doesn't require any prior experience with Python. Start today your path towards data driven decision making!


## Track Learning objectives:

Learner will be able to:
1. Identify different types of business metrics
2. List main methods for importing data to Pandas dataframes
3. Differentiate between various ways of merging separate Pandas dataframes
4. Choose the visualisation tools and techniques that are the most effective for the selected data
5. Demonstrate understanding of key concepts of tree-based models and how they can be applied for regression tasks
6. Analyse the model performance and suggest improvements
7. Recognise the factors that affect the most important metric 


## Courses:

### 1. Introduction to operations management with Python

In this course will learn to recognise the most critical business metrics and distinguish them from the data you have. You will learn more about data-driven approach to business decisions making. Big companies and increasingly small businesses are utilising data to draw insights, define the directions and disrupt entire industries. You will learn more about their journeys while also building foundational skills in Python.

#### Course learning objectives:
Learner will be able to:
  1. Explain the difference between data driven and traditional approach to decision making in business operations
  2. Differentiate between different types of business metrics
  3. Distinguish between different types of data in Python
  4. Analyse simple dataframe using the built-in summary statistics methods

### 2.  Importing financial data with Python

Finance is the life blood of an organisation. This course will teach you to differentiate between various financial metrics, identify the most important ones for your organisation, set the short and long term financial goals. You will learn how to import data from a CSV file into a Pandas dataframe, group and aggregate financial data, analyse trends, calculate your profit, overhead, labour costs and many more!

#### Course learning objectives:
Learner will be able to:
  1. List main financial metrics for an organisation
  2. Distinguish between revenue, net profit, cost and loss
  3. Explain the differences between different formats of tabular data (CSV, TSV, XLS)
  4. Demonstrate knowledge of steps to create a dataframe from a spreadsheet
  5. Analyse numeric data in Pandas dataframe using the built-in aggregation methods
  6. Clean up data
### 3. Importing operational data with Python

Using data is crucial in a modern businesses to gather insights and evaluate performance of your organisation. By establishing clear operational and performance metrics you will clearly see what is working and what is not. Your business will benefit from data-driven decisions regarding your operations, helping you to stay competitive in the market. This course focuses on operational KPIs and metrics that actually bring value. We will begin with the foundations of organisation operations management. You will work with real-life data from marketing, IT and HR projects, learn how Python can help you to aggregate, summarise and visualise datapoints from various sources.  

#### Course learning objectives:
Learner will be able to: 
  1. Explain the approach to identify performance metrics and how they are different from financial metrics
  2. Demonstrate the steps to import data into a dataframe from a CSV file
  3. Analyse and compare metrics from different organisational functions (Marketing, IT, HR)
  4. Clean up data using map(), filter() and reduce() functions
  5. Analyse and visualise complex numeric data using Python

### 4. Merging dataframes with pandas 

This is the existing [DataCamp course on merging dataframes](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/merging-dataframes-with-pandas) Which perfectly covers the foundations of working with multiple dataframes. In this course we would expect the user to be able to merge financial and operarional metrics into one dataframe. As the course already exists, I am not copying the existing course description and objectives.

### 5. Visualising data in Python

"A picture is worth a thousand words". Visualising your data makes the seemingly impossible task of eyeballing thousands of datapoints very straightforward. Data visualisation is essential to expose patterns, correlations and trends in your data and to draw meaningful insights. Use visualisation to tell your story, there is no better way to convey your message to even non-technical stakeholders, than using thoroughly designed visuals. In this course you will learn how to use the most popular tools for data visualisation using Python: Matplotlib and Seaborn. By the time you complete this course you will be able to confidently choose the right type of visualisation for your task, style and annonate it. 

#### Course learning objectives:
Learner will be able to:
  1. Compare most widely used plot types and explain the approach to pick the appropriate type.
  2. Explain the key concepts of regression analysis.
  3. Visualise regression models using scatterplots, regression plots in Seaborn and Matplotlib
  4. Use more complex visualisation techniques using subplots, pair plots in Seaborn and Matplotlib


#### 6. Machine Learning with Tree-Based Models in Python
This is the existing [DataCamp course on machine learning with Tree-based models](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/machine-learning-with-tree-based-models-in-python) Which perfectly covers the foundations of building tree-based models. As the course already exists, I am not copying the existing description and objectives.

### 7. Case study: Building Project analytics and revenue prediction models in Python

In this course, using the real-life financial and operational data from a medium sized marketing agency, you will step-by-step train, test and tweak your machine learning model to analyse and predict your key financial and operational KPIs and draw important insights regarding your business operations. You will explore a particular problem related to marketing projects planning. By building a model you will predict the projects revenue and discover the factors that mostly affect your your target variable.

#### Course learning objectives:
Learner will be able to:
  1. Apply their skills of data wrangling 
  2. Demonstrate their knowledge of the most widely used regression models
  3. Identify the business challenge(s)
  4. Design and evaluate a machine learning model to address the business challenge
