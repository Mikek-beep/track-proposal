# Data-driven operations management and reporting with Python

## Track description:

This track is a gentle introduction to using Python for data-driven business decision making. You will begin this track by discovering different types of business metrics, focusing on operational and financial metrics. You will learn how to import, clean, merge and summarise different types of metrics data, identify, analyse and visualise the most important metrics for your business and create new!

Later in this track you will discover the power of machine learning using tree-based models. Through interactive exercises, using real-world data and powerful Python tools you will train your first machine learning model, tweak it and estimate its accuracy. Most importantly, you will learn how it can help you to get answers to the very real business operations questions. You will build solid understanding of how machine learning can help your business decide where to focus resources and time, how to model your operations and even predict the revenue! 

This is an introductory track and doesn't require any prior experience with Python. Start today your path towards data driven decision making!


## Track Learning objectives:

Learner will be able to:
1. Identify different types of business metrics
2. List main methods for importing data to Pandas dataframes
3. Differentiate between various ways of merging separate Pandas dataframes
4. Choose the visualisation tools and techniques that are the most effective for the selected data
5. Demonstrate understanding of key concepts of tree-based models and how they can be applied for regression tasks
6. Analyse the model performance and suggest improvements
7. Recognise the factors that affect the most important metric 


## Courses:

### 1. Introduction to operations management with Python

In this course will learn to recognise the most critical business metrics and distinguish them from the data you have. You will learn more about data-driven approach to business decisions making. Big companies and increasingly small businesses are utilising data to draw insights, define the directions and disrupt entire industries. You will learn more about their journeys while also building foundational skills in Python.
