# Case study: Building Project analytics and revenue prediction models in Python 

## 1. Exploring the data

### Lesson 1.1 - Introduction to the problem
Learning objective: Using the pre-imported sample datasets remind the student about the key types of business metrics. 
Some functions and packages used: `pandas`, `numpy`

### Lesson 1.2 - Exploring the data
Learning objective: Introduce the student to the datasets. Clean up and merge the data. Using pandas aggregation and summary functions.
Some functions and packages used: `pd.merge()`, `DataFrame.info`, `DataFrame.describe`, `map()` + lambda functions 

### Lesson 1.3 - Defining the challenge
Learning objective: Analyse and visualise the cleaned up data. Define the business challenge
Some functions and packages used: `seaborn`, `matplotlib`
